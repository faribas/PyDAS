PyDAS - A Python wrapper to several differential algebraic system solvers
*************************************************************************

Introduction
============

PyDAS provides a means for Python code to utilize several notable Fortran-based
differential algebraic system solvers from Python code. The solvers made
available -- DASSL, DASPK, and DASKR -- are all publicly-available from 
`Netlib <http://www.netlib.org/ode/>`_, and are distributed with PyDAS. PyDAS
provides a Python extension type for each solver, which in turn provides a
Pythonic means of setting the solver options, providing residual and jacobian
functions, and running the solver.

The DASSL, DASPK, and DASKR solvers are all substantially more robust than
VODE, the solver used within the ODE solver functionality provided by 
`SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_.

Dependencies
============

PyDAS has been tested on Python versions 2.5 and 2.6. It may or may not work
for other Python versions.

There are several Python dependencies that you must install before installing 
PyDAS:

* `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ (versions 2.5.x and 2.6.x are known to work)

* `NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_ (version 1.3.0 or later is recommended)

* `Cython <http://www.cython.org/>`_ (version 0.12.1 or later is recommended)

In addition, you will also need a Fortran compiler and a C compiler that
produce object files that can interoperate. The ``gfortran`` and ``gcc`` 
compiles from the GNU Compiler Collection are known to work. On Windows the
`MinGW <http://www.mingw.org/>`_ compiler collection provides these compilers.

The code for the differential algebraic system solvers DASSL, DASPK, and DASKR
has been provided with the PyDAS package. The licenses for these solvers is
different than that of the PyDAS wrapper code. **You are responsible for knowing
and abiding by all licenses associated with each solver as well as with PyDAS
as a whole.**

Installation
============

.. note:: 

    Currently only the DASSL solver has been wrapped. The installation 
    scripts therefore only build and install the DASSL wrapper by default.

Windows
-------

The provided batch scripts will compile all of the solvers and the PyDAS
wrapper code. These scripts presume that you have the 32-bit version of the
MinGW C and Fortran compilers installed. Once you have run the batch script,
you can install PyDAS into your Python packages if you desire by running the
following command from the base package directory:

    > python setup.py install

Linux
-----

A Makefile has been provided that can be used to compile all of the solvers
and the PyDAS wrapper code. To use, invoke the following command from the
base package directory::

    $ make

This command will build PyDAS in-place, rather than installing it to your
Python package directory. If you wish to formall install PyDAS, run the
following command from the base package directory after the ``make`` command
(you may need root privileges for this)::

    $ python setup.py install

You may wish to write a file `make.inc` that sets certain variables used by
the Makefiles (e.g. the Fortran compiler). An example of such a file, 
`make.inc.example`, has been provided.

*Warning!* When building, ensure there isn't a `pydas.pxd` file anywhere in
your $PYTHONPATH (which there may be if you are an RMG-Py user)

Mac OS X Lion
-------------

Homebrew (http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) is an easy way to get gfortran::

    $ brew install gfortran

But your system may still not be able to find the correct `libgfortran.a` library file 
(see https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/issues/8539 ). This should make it work::

    $ LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/gcc/i686-apple-darwin11/4.2.1/x86_64/ make F77=gfortran

Then, to get it installed into your proper python place::

    $ make install
